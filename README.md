# Duktape-UEFI

This is a UEFI port for Duktape Embedded Javascript Engine, duktape-2.5.0, released November 24, 2019. Edk2-libc is required to build UEFI Shell applications. I built the X64 efi binary with gcc-5 successfully, and confirmed to at least run on ECS Liva Z Plus (i3-7100U) firmware version Feb 16 2017.

Ductape can be obtained from https://duktape.org/
EDK2 and EDK2-libc are available from http://github.com/tianocore/
